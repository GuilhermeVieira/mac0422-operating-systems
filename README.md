Remote communication: synchronous, asynchronous, sockets, remote procedure calls and rendezvous.  

Network communication protocols: IP, TCP, UDP.

Threads: management, synchronization, semaphores, critical sections, monitors.

#### Note
---
<p>There are three programming assignments, the first two were written in C and the last one was written in Python 3, each one of them is in a different folder. Every folder contains the source code and two files: the description of the programming assignment and a report presentation made for the class, both in Portuguese. </p>
