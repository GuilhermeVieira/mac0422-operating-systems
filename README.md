<p>The description of the course:</p>

<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> Expose the students to the computer operating systems fundamentals and its implementations techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Course content:</strong> Introduction to architectures: multiprocessors, parallel distributed memory and networks. Multiprocessing and multiprogramming.

Memory management: real vs virtual memory, paging and segmentation, cache memory.

Processes: states, context, kernel management, scheduling, signals and interruptions.

Local communication: pipes, FIFOs, message queues, shared memory.

Remote communication: synchronous, asynchronous, sockets, remote procedure calls and rendezvous.  

Network communication protocols: IP, TCP, UDP.

Threads: management, synchronization, semaphores, critical sections, monitors.

Input/Output: hardware and software aspects, block and character devices (terminals, drives, clock, network), device independence, drivers.

Types of file systems: sequential, indexed and direct access, hierarchy standard, physical organization and files access, distributed protection mechanisms.

Security.

<p>There are three programming assignments, the first two were written in C and the last one was written in Python 3, each one of them is in a different folder. Every folder contains the source code and two files: the description of the programming assignment and a report presentation made for the class, both in Portuguese. </p>
