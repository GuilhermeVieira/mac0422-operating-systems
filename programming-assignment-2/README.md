The python script was made to run the program several times to make statistical experiments for the report.

To compile the binaries run the following command on the terminal:

`make
`

To remove the .o files created in the compilation process and the binary file generated, run:

`make clean`

The following command runs the shell:

`./ep2 d n v`

where d > 249, 5 < n ≤ 5 × d and v is multiple of 2. The meaning of these values is described in the assignment description.
